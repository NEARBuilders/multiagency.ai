# Agency Dashboard skill

## Purpose

Understand and interact with this Agency Dashboard deployment as a runtime-composed site on NEAR, extending the everything.dev runtime. This deployment is maintained by MultiAgency. The underlying template is at github.com/MultiAgency/dashboard — instantiate via `bunx everything-dev init` to customize per agency.

## Core model

- `bos.config.json` is the canonical runtime manifest.
- The host is the runtime shell and trust boundary.
- The UI is loaded at runtime through Module Federation.
- The API is loaded at runtime through `every-plugin`.
- Public metadata may describe the runtime, but should not replace the runtime manifest.

## Bootstrap flow

- Publish the root `bos.config.json` first at `dev.everything.near/everything.dev`.
- The root record should not extend anything while it is the bootstrap source of truth.
- After that root is live, other configs can extend it with `bos://dev.everything.near/everything.dev`.
- `domain` is the public open-app URL; use it for app launch links, not `hostUrl`.

## Useful assumptions

- The bootstrap site is published from `dev.everything.near/everything.dev`.
- This site extends the everything.dev bootstrap (`bos://dev.everything.near/everything.dev`).
- Agency-specific surfaces — public projects directory, apply form, and the authenticated admin workspace (projects, contributors, budgets, billings, applications) — are wired end-to-end via the API plugin. Admin routes are gated server-side by Sputnik DAO role membership.
- Multiple sites may share the same host configuration.
- Host URLs can stay stable while published runtime records change over time.
- The project is meant to be continuously built over and around.

## Good tasks

- Explain how a published runtime is assembled
- Inspect the relationship between host, UI, and API
- Compare canonical config with public metadata
- Help authors understand runtime inheritance and composition

## Public entry points

- `/` — landing
- `/work` — projects directory (enriched live from NEARN where linked)
- `/apply` — express-interest form (contributor)
- `/register` — express-interest form (founder)
- `/contact` — express-interest form (client)
- `/README.md`
- `/skill.md`
- `/llms.txt`

## Tone

Prefer runtime-first explanations.
Keep NEAR-specific context, but avoid reducing the site to branding alone.
Treat the project as a living public runtime surface, not a fixed demo.
